## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loading, echo=TRUE}
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r mean, echo=TRUE}
#df$date <- as.Date(as.character(df$date))
# 1. Total number of steps taken per day
steps_by_date <- tapply(df$steps, df$date, FUN=sum, na.rm = T)
# 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(steps_by_date, main="Steps Taken Per Day", xlab="Steps")
# 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean_steps <- mean(steps_by_date)
medium_steps <- median(steps_by_date)
```
Mean of the total number of steps taken per day: `r mean_steps`  
Medium of the total number of steps taken per day: `r medium_steps`
